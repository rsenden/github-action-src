This action allows for setting up the Fortify tools listed below. Which tools and which versions to install, and whether to add the tool bin-directories to the system path, is controlled through action inputs as listed in the next section.

* [fcli](https://github.com/fortify/fcli)
* [ScanCentral Client]({{var:sc-client-doc-base-url}}#A_Clients.htm)
* [FoDUploader](https://github.com/fod-dev/fod-uploader-java)
* [FortifyVulnerabilityExporter](https://github.com/fortify/FortifyVulnerabilityExporter)
* [FortifyBugTrackerUtility](https://github.com/fortify-ps/FortifyBugTrackerUtility)

### Action inputs

**`export-path`** - OPTIONAL    
Whether to add the installed tools to the system PATH variable. Allowed values: `true` (default) or `false`

**`fcli`** - OPTIONAL    
The fcli version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install fcli), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v2` will install the latest known `2.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v2.0.0` and `2.0.0` are semantically the same.

**`sc-client`** - OPTIONAL    
The ScanCentral Client version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `23.1` will install the latest known `23.1.y` patch version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v23.1` and `23.1` are semantically the same.

**`fod-uploader`** - OPTIONAL    
The FoDUploader version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v5` will install the latest known `5.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v5.4.0` and `5.4.0` are semantically the same.

**`vuln-exporter`** - OPTIONAL    
The FortifyVulnerabilityExporter version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v2` will install the latest known `2.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v2.0.4` and `2.0.4` are semantically the same.

**`bugtracker-utility`** - OPTIONAL    
The FortifyBugTrackerUtility version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v4` will install the latest known `4.x` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v4.12` and `4.12` are semantically the same.

### Action outputs

For each tool being installed, the action outputs several environment variables for use by later workflow steps.

**`PATH`**    
If the `export-path` action input was set to `true` (default), the bin-directory of the installed tool will be added to the workflow `PATH` environment variable.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_INSTALL_DIR`**    
Directory where the corresponding tool was installed. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_INSTALL_DIR`.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_BIN_DIR`**    
Bin-directory that holds the executables for the corresponding tool. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_BIN_DIR`.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_CMD`**    
Fully qualified path to the (primary) executable/script for the corresponding tool. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_CMD`.

### Sample usage

The sample workflow below demonstrates how to configure the action for installing the various Fortify tools and how to run these tools. Some notes:

* The `export-path` and `bugtracker-utility` inputs are set to their default values, and thus could have been omitted.
* The action supports semantic versioning, so the `vuln-exporter` input will install the latest known v2.x.y version of FortifyVulnerabilityExporter.

```yaml
    steps:    
      - name: Setup Fortify tools
        uses: fortify/github-action/setup@{{var:action-major-version}}
        with:
          export-path: true
          fcli: latest
          sc-client: 23.1.0
          fod-uploader: latest
          vuln-exporter: v2
          bugtracker-utility: skip
      - name: Run fcli from PATH
        run: fcli -V
      - name: Run fcli using FCLI_CMD environment variable
        run: ${FCLI_CMD} -V
