This action exports the latest vulnerability data from an SSC application version to the GitHub Code Scanning dashboard. Note that this may require a [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) subscription, unless you're running this action on a public github.com repository.

### Action environment variable inputs

**`SSC_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify Software Security Center URL, for example https://ssc.customer.fortifyhosted.net/

Required when authenticating with an SSC token (recommended). Most actions should work fine with a `CIToken`.
